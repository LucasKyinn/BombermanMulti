**Developed with Unreal Engine 5**

School project / Personal Project 

Project aim was to make a multiplayer Bomberman like game in Unreal Engine.

Fist full game I make a lot of things to improve but I really just want to move to another project.
Made all the game features without thinking about replication right away, making changing things really tedious.


## Project Overview
    -Map creation and random generation
    -Player Setup (Input , Camera, Gamemode)
    -Menus
    -HUDs
    -Replication

### Known Bug:
    -Can take double damage if standing in between two Tiles -> Really handy for testing really easy to fix
    -Bomb placement animation plays twice on server if a client place a bomb -> I dont want to risk breaking everything so it will stay that way for now
    -HUD is all over the place if their is more than 2 players making it hard to track where the players health is at -> Personal project so w/e
    -I cant remember the other bugs :(

### Missing Features:
    -Solo Mode and an AI to play against -> Focus of this project was Multiplayer 
    -Loading screens -> Part of polishing dont want to do that rn
    -Polish (visual and sound) -> ZZZZzzzzz....
