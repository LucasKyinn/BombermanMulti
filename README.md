### Known Bug:
    -Can take double damage if standing in between two Tiles  (Was handy for testing damages, really easy to fix).
    -Bomb placement animation plays twice on server if a client place a bomb.
    -HUD is all over the place if their are more than 2 players making it hard to track where your health bar is at

### Missing Features:
    -Solo Mode and an AI to play against -> Focus of this project was Multiplayer 
    -Polishing (Loading screen for example)
